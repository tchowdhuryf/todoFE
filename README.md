## Setting Up the Backend
1. git clone **url repo string**
2. npm i - to install all packages
3. set up a .env file
    - include PORT & mongoURI variables for server and to connect to DB
4. npm start = to begin running terminal

## Setting Up the Front End

2. npm i - to install all packages
3. npm run dev - to run application

## Summary

This project is a full-stack application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, leveraging modern tools and frameworks to ensure seamless functionality and scalability. MongoDB was utilized for its flexibility in data storage, while Mongoose was employed for schema definition and data validation. The frontend was set up with Vite to streamline development and optimize build performance. The primary goal of this project was to deliver a robust, responsive, and user-friendly experience with a clear emphasis on organization and maintainability.

The backend architecture was structured following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. Models were designed to represent and validate the core data structures, controllers handled application logic, and views facilitated communication between these layers. This modular approach not only enhances readability but also ensures that each component is reusable and easy to debug. On the frontend, a single-page interface empowers users to create, read, update, and delete todos, minimizing the need for navigation and simplifying interactions.

Attention was given to creating a neatly packaged, bug-free application that functions intuitively for end users. By prioritizing organization and clarity, both the frontend and backend work cohesively to deliver a responsive and efficient system. This project demonstrates a commitment to high-quality software design, focusing on a maintainable codebase while delivering a smooth and consistent user experience.
